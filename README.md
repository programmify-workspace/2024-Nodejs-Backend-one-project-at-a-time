# Node.js Backend - One Project At A Time

## Introduction

Welcome to the Node.js Backend project series! In this series of projects, you will learn how to build various Node.js applications by tackling one project at a time. Each project focuses on a specific topic or feature, allowing you to gradually gain a deeper understanding of Node.js and its capabilities. Let's get started!

After some thought processes and thinking back to how I got better at coding, I have decided to come up with a strategy that I have been working on for a while now. I think I will help every one of us become backend developers with solid knowledge in either PHP & Laravel stack or JavaScript & Node.js stack. And good knowledge of Databases.

We will call it **Node.js Backend - One Project At A Time**. This program comprises 10 projects with user stories, descriptions, and concepts. This is an opportunity for you to leverage your front-end strengths with the backend you are learning.

## Duration

The estimated duration for completing all 10 projects is approximately 30 days - 60 days.

## Technologies

You can use any frontend framework or technologies, such as HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6, ES5, ES7), Bootstrap, Tailwind, SCSS, Saas, TypeScript, React, Vue, etc. However, our main focus will be on the backend technologies.

For those who selected PHP:

- Main Target: PHP, Laravel, MySQL, PostgreSQL, APIs.

For those who selected Node.js:

- Main Target: Node.js, JavaScript, TypeScript, Express, MySQL, PostgreSQL, APIs.

## Project Structure

The projects are designed to help you gain practical experience in building real-world applications. Each project will have a user story, description, and concepts that you will learn as you build them. Feel free to choose a frontend template that suits the specific project you are working on, allowing you to focus primarily on the backend development.
